# Maze Game
# Project Overview
This project is a Maze Game that combines Data Structures and Algorithms with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It includes a maze-solving functionality powered by Dijkstra's algorithm and provides an interactive experience for users to navigate and solve mazes.
# Features
•	Maze Generation: Dynamically generates different mazes for gameplay.
•	Interactive GUI: User-friendly interface for playing and solving mazes.
•	Pathfinding: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in the maze.
•	Difficulty Levels: Offers various levels to challenge players.
