# Maze Game

## Project Overview
The Maze Game combines the power of **Data Structures and Algorithms** with a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** to deliver an interactive and engaging maze-solving experience. With dynamic maze generation and Dijkstra's algorithm, players can navigate or watch the maze being solved automatically.

---

## Features
- **Maze Generation**: Dynamically generates unique mazes for each gameplay session.
- **Interactive GUI**: A user-friendly interface designed for seamless navigation and gameplay.
- **Pathfinding**: Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest path in the maze.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Offers scalable challenges for players of all skill levels.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**
   - Ensure JDK 8 or higher is installed on your system.
   - Add `java` and `javac` to your system's PATH environment variable.

2. **Required Files**
   - Download the project folder, which includes the following:
     - `Cell.java`
     - `MazeGame.java`
     - `MazeGUI.java`
     - `DijkstraSolver.java`
     - `Maze.java`
     - `Levels.java`
     - `MazeGame.png`
     - Supporting `.class` files (if precompiled)

   > **Note**: Name the folder `DSA_Final_Project`, or remove the `package` declarations in the Java files if you do not wish to use a specific package.

## Steps to Run

### Option 1: Using an IDE
1. Open an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code.
2. Import the project folder into the IDE.
3. Compile all the `.java` files.
4. Run the `MazeGame` class to launch the game.

### Option 2: Using the Command Line
1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.
2. Compile all Java files:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```
3. Run the main program:
   ```bash
   java MazeGame
   ```

## How to Play
1. **Launch the Game**: 
   - Start the program to open the GUI.
2. **Select a Difficulty Level**: 
   - Choose from the available levels to set the challenge.
3. **Navigate the Maze**:
   - Use arrow keys to move through the maze in "Human Mode".
4. **Automatic Solver**:
   - Switch to the "Let Computer Solve" mode to see Dijkstra's algorithm in action.

## Important Notes
- Ensure all files in the project folder remain intact and are not renamed or removed.
- The game requires a **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** to execute compiled `.class` files.
- The GUI is optimized for players of all skill levels, with scalable difficulty settings.
